# CIVIA

## Overview
We develop a wallet prototype with social recovery and social graph based on the account abstraction functions on Starknet. 

Wallets are possibly the most frequently used Web3 infrastructure apps. We design Civia so that the wallet can be used for social purposes in addition to crypto asset transactions. In Civia, users get invited by friends to install the app and setup their real-life friends as guardians for the social recovery. Users can also follow friends and browse their wallets. These activities create users' social graph on-chain. 

The real-person based social recovery process is more secure and reliable than traditional wallets. On-chain non-transferable data locked in the wallet contracts such as SBTs and user social graph can be recovered if wallets get lost. In fact, users own and can take these data anywhere when they login to DApps with wallet address.

We hope the Civia wallet can find applications in the area of Web3 identities, reputations and social relations.
